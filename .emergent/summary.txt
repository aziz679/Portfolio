The final and current request is to create a portfolio where the UI, design, colors, and animations are directly inspired by the website .

The portfolio should include:
- A hero section with a strong tagline.
- Detailed project pages for AI Kaptan, Emareach AI, Ralvie Frontdesk, and AI Unleashed, complete with screenshots and metrics.
- A comprehensive work experience section derived from the user's CV.
- A tech stack section with real logos.
- A consistent, minimalist, and modern design across all pages, inspired by the provided reference site.
- All content and messaging should follow a confident, human-focused tone similar to the Mark Progano portfolio example provided earlier.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully created a single, functional homepage () that is inspired by the user's reference site (). It features a minimalist dark theme, a hero section, and placeholders for project and capability sections. All the necessary data for the portfolio, including detailed project descriptions, screenshots, work experience from the CV, and tech stack, has been gathered and is stored in  and . The multi-page routing structure is in place but currently points to older, unstyled pages, except for the new homepage.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS,  for multi-page navigation.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (currently unused as the portfolio is frontend-only with mock data).
- **Architecture:** Frontend-only static site with data hardcoded in JavaScript modules.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (The application is currently frontend-only and does not use the database).

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all project data, tech stack, and personal info. Essential for building the new pages.
- : Contains all detailed work experience from the user's CV.
- : The starting point and style guide for the new design.
- : The file that will need updates to wire up the new pages.
- : The main application component.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user has pivoted multiple times. The current and final direction is to create a portfolio heavily inspired by . Do not deviate from this design language.
- All the content needed for the portfolio is already gathered in the  directory. No further content generation is needed; the focus is purely on UI implementation.
- The agent should proceed by analyzing the remaining pages of the reference site (, , ) and creating new React components that replicate that style using the existing data.
- The user expects advanced animations and a high-quality finish.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.
